# Speaker recognition papers' implementation
These are the slightly modified tensorflow/python implementation of recent speaker recognition papers.

These codes do not include feature extraction and main program. If you want to use some models, you need to write the extraction and main program by yourself.

The file structure is as followsï¼š
```
---PaperName (folder)

------models (folder)
---------DataManage.py (Class of batch managing.)
---------model.py (Class of this model)

------config.py (Settings. e.g. save path, learning rate)
```
If you want run these codes on your computer, you only need to modify config.oy and write code as follow:
```python
import PaperName.models as model

M = models.model()
M.run(train_data, train_label, test_data=None, test_label=None)

# If the test_data or test_label is none, you will only get the trained model. 
# You can do this when you needn't the ACC/EER information.
```
